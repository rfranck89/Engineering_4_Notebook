## Launchpad_1

### Description

Normal: Write code that prints numbers that count down from ten, one every second, and print 'Liftoff!' when the number reaches zero.

Spicy: There is no spicy version of this assignment

### Wiring

There was no wiring for this assignment, just code.

### Code
Code can be found [here](https://github.com/rfranck89/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/countdown.py)
### Reflection

I didn't really learn anything from this assignment. The instructions on canvas tell you how to code almost the whole thing, and I already knew how for loops worked.

## Launchpad_2

### Description

Normal: make a red LED blink once every second during the countdown, then when the timer reaches zero turn on a green LED.

### Code

### Reflection

This assignment taught me how to wire and code an LED, and also what the difference between input and output is.

## Launchpad_3

### Description

Normal: make the countdown only start when a button is pressed.

Spicy: if the button is pressed during the countdown, print ABORT and stop the countdown.

## Crash_Avoidance_1

### Description

Normal: Make an accelerometer print x, y, and z acceleration.

### Code

### Reflection

This assignment was pretty easy for both code and wiring, because the canvas module says how to wire the accelerometer and how to print the values. This assignment taught me that wevideo has a delay before it records the window you select, which will help me record better videos.

## Beam Assignment

### Assignment Description

Create a beam in onshape that can hold a weight without breaking or bending more than 35 mm.
The beam must follow the following criteria:
 - weigh less than 13 grams including the attachment block.
 - no vertical angles less than 45 degrees are allowed.
 - the center of the hole used to hold the weight must be 180 mm away from the edge of the attachment block.
 - the attachment block must be able to fit into the holder with the beam.
 - the beam must use the hole given in the assignment

### Reflection

there were only two challenging parts on this assignment, making it weigh less than 13 grams and making it not have overhangs.
