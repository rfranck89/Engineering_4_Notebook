## Launchpad_1

### Description

Normal: Write code that prints numbers that count down from ten, one every second, and print 'Liftoff!' when the number reaches zero.

Spicy: There is no spicy version of this assignment

### Wiring

There was no wiring for this assignment, just code.

### Code
Code can be found [here](https://github.com/rfranck89/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/countdown.py)
### Reflection

I didn't really learn anything from this assignment. The instructions on canvas tell you how to code almost the whole thing, and I already knew how for loops worked.

## Crash_Avoidance_1

### Description

Normal: Make an accelerometer print x, y, and z acceleration.

### Reflection

This assignment was pretty easy for both code and wiring, because the canvas module says how to wire the accelerometer and how to print the values. This assignment taught me that wevideo has a delay before it records the window you select, which will help me record better videos.

## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
