## Launchpad_1

### Description

Normal: Write code that prints numbers that count down from ten, one every second, and print 'Liftoff!' when the number reaches zero.

Spicy: There is no spicy version of this assignment

### Wiring

There was no wiring for this assignment, just code.

### Code
Code can be found [here](https://github.com/rfranck89/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/countdown.py)
### Reflection

I didn't really learn anything from this assignment. The instructions on canvas tell you how to code almost the whole thing, and I already knew how for loops worked.

## Crash_Avoidance_1

### Description

Normal: Make an accelerometer print x, y, and z acceleration.

### Reflection

This assignment was pretty easy for both code and wiring, because the canvas module says how to wire the accelerometer and how to print the values. This assignment taught me that wevideo has a delay before it records the window you select, which will help me record better videos.

## Beam Assignment

### Assignment Description

Create a beam in onshape that can hold a weight without breaking or bending more than 35 mm.
The beam must follow the following criteria:
 - weigh less than 13 grams including the attachment block.
 - no vertical angles less than 45 degrees are allowed.
 - the center of the hole used to hold the weight must be 180 mm away from the edge of the attachment block.
 - the attachment block must be able to fit into the holder with the beam.
 - the beam must use the hole given in the assignment

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
